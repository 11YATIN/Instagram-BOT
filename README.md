# Instagram-BOT

This Python script leverages the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to automate interactions with Instagram. It starts by securely logging into an Instagram account using provided credentials. Once logged in, it performs a series of tasks, including:

- Searching for handles related to specific topics like "food" and "So Delhi."
- Following or unfollowing a handle ("So Delhi").
- Searching for specific Instagram handles like "dilsefoodie" and interacting with their posts.
- Collecting and displaying followers of handles such as "foodtalkindia" and "sodelhi."
- Checking and printing the followers that the user is following.
- Exploring the Instagram handle "coding.ninjas," checking for available stories, and viewing them if present.

This project demonstrates effective automation of Instagram interactions using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup libraries. It covers essential tasks such as login, searching, following/unfollowing, liking posts, and checking stories.
